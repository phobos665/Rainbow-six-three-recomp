/**
 * Manual function overrides and ICALL diagnostics
 *
 * This file provides:
 *   - recomp_lookup_manual()  : intercept specific Xbox VAs with hand-written code
 *   - recomp_icall_fail_log() : log when an indirect call target can't be resolved
 *   - ICALL trace ring buffer  : globals used by the RECOMP_ICALL macro
 *
 * The recomp pipeline generates an auto-dispatch table (recomp_lookup) that
 * resolves most function addresses. recomp_lookup_manual() is called FIRST,
 * giving you a chance to override any function with a custom implementation.
 *
 * Common reasons to add manual overrides:
 *   - Trace a function to understand call flow (wrap the generated version)
 *   - Fix a function the lifter translated incorrectly
 *   - Stub out a function that crashes (return early, set eax to a safe value)
 *   - Redirect a function to a native implementation (e.g., skip CRT init)
 *   - Intercept D3D/audio calls for custom rendering or sound

 * -- two threads' reports spliced together, with a caller list that stops
 * mid-sentence and an address that belongs to neither line as read. These
 * diagnostics exist to be read during exactly the multi-threaded bring-up
 * that breaks them.
 *
 * The CRT exposes the lock these calls were already taking one at a time, so

/*
 * The title's allocator is Unreal's pooled FMalloc: it takes 64 KB pools from
 * NtAllocateVirtualMemory and finds a block's pool from ptr >> 16, which is
 * exact on the console, where every region starts on the 64 KB allocation
 * granularity. With regions packed 4 KB apart two pools shared a window, the
 * lookup handed out a block inside a live one, and the first string append
 * at start-up copied a string onto itself (FString += at 0x00011450, source
 * 8 bytes below its destination) until it ran off the end of memory.
 * RECOMP_VA_64K gives each region its own window; the pools ask for 64 KB
 * anyway, so it costs this title almost nothing.
 *
 * RECOMP_ETHERNET_LINK=0 too: with no network card the honest answer is "no
 * cable". With the link reported up, XNet ran DHCP against nobody and the
 * start-up loop on XNetGetTitleXnAddr (0x001D0710) waited 25 to 100 s for it
 * to give up.
 *
 * Not set: RECOMP_TITLE_INTERVAL. The title asks D3D for 30 fps
 * (D3DPRESENT_INTERVAL_TWO_OR_IMMEDIATE), but its game is timed by the clock
 * (Unreal's delta time; no fixed step anywhere in the XBE), and the one thing
 * it stepped once a frame, the Bink movies, is paced by the clock below. So
 * it runs at 60, checked by hand in play on 12 Oct 2026.
 * RECOMP_TITLE_INTERVAL=1 holds it to the console's 30.
 *
 * Both are set before main, and only if the variable is not already set, so
 * =0 or =1 on the command line still wins.

 * at 30 (it asks D3D for INTERVAL_TWO) and every movie is 30 fps, so one call
 * a frame is one movie frame. At 60 the intro, the menu backgrounds and the

 *
 * This wrapper is what makes 60 possible without touching the movies: it

 * is re-based rather than raced to catch up. RECOMP_RS3_MOVIE_PACE=0 turns
